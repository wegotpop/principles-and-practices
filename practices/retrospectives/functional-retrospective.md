title: Functional Retrospective
---

This is a recurring (currently once every two weeks) retrospective that due to historical reasons is also sometimes called the "Sprint Retrospective".

## Format

This is typically a simple "Went Well", "Didn't go well" format with topics being written anonymously then grouped by a facilitator before being voted on in terms of priority to discuss.

The retrospective is typically timeboxed and also includes a review of previous action items.

## What went well?

The functional retrospective is meant to capture individual sentiment on issues and is meant to provoke a discussion that helps align and normalise views across the group.

Only raise issues that you personally understand and believe in. If you think other people have problems that they are not raising at the retro you should raise and issue *about that* rather than trying to add an issue that you might not fully understand.

Whether something went well or not is entirely based on how you feel it about. The items are grouped by theme so it's not uncommon to have the same topic containing elements that are positive and negative.

There is also some wriggle room, typically new starters get a "Went Well" topic even though there isn't anything to discuss or there have been problems during the onboarding process.

### Try to participate

It is a good idea to use the functional retrospective as a chance to reflect on your own work. If you think back about the work you've been doing since the last retrospective it should be easy to think about something that has been going well and something that hasn't gone so well.

Often people find it hard to remember what has happened since the last retrospective, if this is true for you try to make some notes at the end of each day to remind yourself for the retrospective.

Some people also like to add items to retrospective as soon as it is opened.

## Suitable Topics

* Development processes (Debug Ducks, planning, deployments)
* Functional organisation (teams)
* Functional practices (TDD, Security, Automated Code formatting)
* Best practices across teams
* Anything that doesn't seem to fit elsewhere

## Less Suitable Topics

Things that mostly affect single teams (working with EP, financial controls) are probably better discussed within teams in the appropriate team forums. This is because the context of the problem is less likely to be understood at a functional level.

Particular issues or problems that occurred (releases reverts, cancelled rollouts) are probably best handled by a retrospective for that particular incident, again due to the need for context. However those retrospectives might reveal a broader lesson or discussion point that would be worth handling at a functional level.

Proposals to change or introduce a practice, tool or piece of technology are better handled through the [proposal process]({{site.baseurl}}{%link practices/technical-proposals.md %}).
