title: Incident Retrospective
---

Incident retrospectives look at a particular problem in a great deal of depth to identify opportunities to improve. They generally only involve those people directly involved with the incident.

Some incidents mandate the need for a retrospective and the format that this takes.

Other smaller incidents (like reverted releases) can be handled in a much more informal way using an impromptu format.

Generally incident retrospectives focus on:

* What exactly happened?
* What opportunities did we have to stop the problem occurring?
* What can we change to prevent this type of problem recurring?
* Is the problem something that identifies a bigger, systemic problem?
