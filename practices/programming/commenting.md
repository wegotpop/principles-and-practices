title: Commenting Code
---

Generally tried to avoid writing comments, in general if you are having to comment code then it is a sign that you are trying to paper over other problems that demand a more difficult solution than a comment.

One area where comments may be valid is in very terse or abstract code where verbose English names might be inappropriate. In this case though try to see if a test suite might be a better way to document the behaviour or whether the terseness of the code is justified.

> Indeed, the ratio of time spent reading versus writing is well over 10 to 1. We are constantly reading old code as part of the effort to write new code.
