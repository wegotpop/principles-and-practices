title: Making a technical proposal
---

Technical proposals are a bit like [Requests for comments (RFCs)(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_Comments) in that they aim to provide enough information to create an informed discussion and capture the feedback that refines the proposal into something that can actually be done and the impact it has can be judged.

Proposals can be very broad and cover a range of things including changes to the internal systems, adoption of new technology, changes to process and technology retirements.

## Structure

The proposal should have the following sections as a minimum but depending on the nature of the proposal there may be additional sections to describe the idea fully.

Once a proposal is discussed then the document can also be updated with the record of the discussion including any follow up questions and answers.

### What is the problem?

What is the problem we have identified? Give the context and the impact of the problem. Ideally this will entirely be in the domain language unless the idea is a very niche technical issue.

The impact of the problem should also be described in terms of value to clients primarily and POP itself as secondary objective.

### What are you proposing?

A clear and short description of what you are proposing to do along with links to help an unfamiliar reader learn about the subject.

### How will it fix the problem?

In this section you should explain how the proposed change fixes the identified problem. This should include any important information about how long the solution will require to address the problem and how it will be possible to verify that the change resulted in the fix.

This section typically needs a bit of work as the proposal is refined so don't worry too much 

## Proposal review

Try and get someone to review your proposal and give you feedback before sharing it more widely. When you are ready to share it, add the document to the Proposals folder (within the Development Team folder) and share the the link via email or Slack along with an introduction to what the proposal is about.
