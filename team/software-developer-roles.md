## Apprentice Software Developer

An Apprentice should progress to Associate within 12 months of joining so this is really just an intermediate role. There should be  structured training and career development to move someone into the Associate role.

## Associate Software Developer

An Associate mostly works under the supervision of others and to agreed scopes of work. They often focus on routine tasks or those that use established patterns and solutions by the company.

They may have an area of expertise or knowledge that they work on exclusively but in general they make team contributions.

## Software Developer

A software developer can work independently on a typical task requirement to maintain and extend the existing functionality of the platform.

Their work is typically high quality, meeting the expectations of clients and their fellow team members. They understand when their work fits common patterns already in use in our systems and when new solutions need to be created.

When estimating a feature, the actual work is inside the original estimate range more often than it is outside. The developer has a good intuition for both the work required, their ability to carry out the necessary changes and the existing state of the codebase.

A software developer understands the business context of the change they are making and is capable of explaining this to colleagues during reviews of their work. When they discover new information in the course of development they pro-actively communicate these changes to their collaborators.

They present and share knowledge in established channels within the team such as wikis, demos and showcases.

## Lead Software Developer

Responsible for guiding the work of other developers. Can abstract a piece of feature work to create a reusable or extensible piece of technology that other members of the team can use.

Helps deliver complex projects over long periods (more than a single quarter) bring leadership and coherence to work that might be divided amongst many people.

Their work is delivered with few quality issues and is generally received well by users and clients. It is only rarely delivered outside any associated estimate range.

Understands problems that other functions and people in the business have and takes the initiative to find low-effort technical solutions to them.

Finds ways to automate processes to improve the effectiveness of the development teamâ€™s delivery.

They actively promote knowledge sharing on technical matters and are capable of sharing information that takes into account the needs and preferences of other team members.

They take steps to ensure that their teams and collaborators have a shared, mutual context of the work that is going on at both the tactical (immediate level) and the strategic level (how individual work links together to achieve the wider business objective).
