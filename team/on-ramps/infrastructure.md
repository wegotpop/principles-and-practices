We would recommend that you spend 9 to 12 months in application development if you do not have existing AWS or operations experience.

## Suggested Training

The AWS Developer Associate Certification training gives a good overview of all the basic AWS services and how to fit them together in the context of a web application. You do not actually have to take the certification. You can make a request this training via your line manager. We have previous used the ACloud Guru course via the Udemy training site.

AWS also offers a free [Learning Library](https://www.aws.training/LearningLibrary?query=&filters=Language%3A1%20SkillLevel%3A6%20Domain%3A101%2C20%2C110%2C71%2C91%20DeliveryFormat%3A1%2C4%2C6%2C7%2C8) which offers a good general introduction to several important services.

## Initial Steps

Working on the local development environment is a good place to start developing skills around Docker, OS management and the basic integration with AWS services.

Typical tasks include:

* OS version updates
* Python version updates
* Adding new tools in the Continuous Integration Pipeline

While on support duty it can also be useful to spend sometime studying the CloudWatch and Sentry logs to see how a working infrastructure works and the kind of problems and self-corrections that occur in the managed systems.

The system also uses Lambdas to provide some of the functionality of the platform and these areas offer an opportunity to interact with infrastructure as code and AWS service design.
